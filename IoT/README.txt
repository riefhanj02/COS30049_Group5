Wildlife Conservation IoT Project - README
Introduction
This project involves the development of an IoT system for wildlife conservation using M5Stack Fire and ESP32 devices. The system integrates various sensors, including motion detectors and cameras, to monitor wildlife and protect habitats.

Requirements
To get started with this project, you'll need to install the Arduino IDE and necessary libraries for M5Stack Fire and ESP32. Please follow the instructions below to set up the environment for development.

1. Install Arduino IDE
If you don't have the Arduino IDE installed yet, follow these steps:

Download the Arduino IDE from the official website:
Arduino IDE Downloads

Install the IDE by following the setup instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

2. Install M5Stack Fire and ESP32 Board Support
Once the Arduino IDE is installed, you need to install board support for M5Stack Fire and ESP32. Follow these steps:

Open the Arduino IDE.
Go to File > Preferences.
In the Additional Boards Manager URLs field, add the following URL:
arduino
Copy code
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json
Click OK to save the preferences.
Next, go to Tools > Board > Boards Manager.
Search for ESP32 in the list.
Click Install for the esp32 by Espressif Systems.
Similarly, search for M5Stack in the Boards Manager and install the M5Stack board package.
3. Install Required Libraries
You will need to install a few libraries for the sensors and components used in this project.

M5Stack Library
This library provides support for M5Stack Fire hardware.

Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for M5Stack and click Install.
Adafruit Sensor Library
This is needed for the environmental sensors like temperature, humidity, and pressure.

Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for Adafruit Sensor and click Install.
DHT Sensor Library (for DHT11 or DHT22 sensors)

Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for DHT sensor library and click Install.
PIR Sensor Library
If you are using a PIR motion sensor, install the IRremote library.

Go to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries.
Search for IRremote and click Install.
4. Select the Right Board and Port
After installing the necessary libraries:

Go to Tools > Board and select ESP32 Dev Module (or M5Stack Fire depending on your hardware).
Go to Tools > Port and select the correct port for your device (this may vary depending on the connected hardware).

5. Upload the Code
Once everything is set up, you can now upload the code to the device:

Open the project code in the Arduino IDE.
Click the Upload button (the right arrow) in the IDE.
Wait for the upload to complete. After uploading, the system should start functioning as intended.

6. Troubleshooting
Ensure that your board is connected properly to the computer.
If you see any errors during the upload process, check that the correct board and port are selected in Tools.
If you encounter issues with libraries, verify that they are installed correctly by checking Sketch > Include Library.
Conclusion
Once you have installed the necessary libraries and set up the environment, you should be ready to run and test the IoT system for wildlife conservation. If you need further assistance, feel free to consult the documentation for the specific sensors or hardware you're using.
